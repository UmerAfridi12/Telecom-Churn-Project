# Telecom-Churn-Project


Objective: 
Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom provider, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.

Predictive Modeling:
Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to improve model performance.
Built a machine learning pipeline using XGBoost, achieving high accuracy and interpretability in churn prediction.
Balanced class distribution using SMOTEENN for reliable predictions on imbalanced datasets.

Database Management:
Designed and implemented a MySQL database with optimized schema for storing customer, service, account, and churn data.
Ensured data consistency and improved query performance through normalization and efficient indexing.

Web App Development:
Developed a Flask-based web application with API endpoints to serve predictions, facilitating seamless integration with client workflows.
Created a user-friendly interface using HTML, JavaScript, and Flask, enabling easy data input for real-time churn predictions.

LLM Integration:
Integrated a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with Google Gemini Pro to generate query-based insights from SQL databases.
Enhanced business intelligence capabilities by enabling natural language query interpretation and data-driven insights.
Tools & Technologies: Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, and other ML algorithms), SQL/MySQL, Flask, Postman, JavaScript, HTML, SMOTEENN.
